## Overview
NOS (Native OS) UI is a jQuery library containing useful, extensible and easily stylable browser components. The idea is to have the custom functionality work as close to native component functionality as possible. With JavaScript disabled the default component functionality will still work without a problem.

### Form elements
State changes to the custom form element are mirrored on the actual form elements themselves, therefore as far as the server and the DOM is concerned, there are no custom form elements. 

### BEM friendly
The [BEM](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/) CSS methodology played a big role in the NOS UI design. Changing the object's CSS namespace is encouraged.
